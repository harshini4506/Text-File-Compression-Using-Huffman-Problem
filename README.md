# Text-File-Compression-Using-Huffman-Problem
This project implements Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm in C. It reads an input file, calculates character frequencies, builds a Huffman Tree, and generates Huffman codes to compress the file.

Features:

Reads an input file and calculates character frequencies.

Constructs a Huffman Tree and generates variable-length binary codes.

Saves the compressed output in compressed.txt.

Displays the compression ratio and file size reduction.
